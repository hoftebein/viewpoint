## Short description.

The program for displaying images from the current directory or the specified directory. Scrolling through images is carried out with the left and right arrow keys.

## Prerequisites.

Before compiling this application, the SFML library must be installed on your system. 

In Linux, the library can be installed with the command

In Windows, the library archive must be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/) of the developer and unpacked into a directory.

My project for Visual Studio 2022 is set to the location of the library in: C:\SFML-2.5.1

Compilation.

In Windows:
1. Copy all .dll files from the bin directory from the SFML library to the project directory.
2. Open the project with Visual Studio and compile.
